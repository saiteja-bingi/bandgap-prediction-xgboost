# Band Gap Prediction using XGBoost

This project uses an XGBoost machine learning model to predict the band gap of materials based on their chemical properties.

## Features
- Uses Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for regression
- Processes material chemistry data
- Outputs predicted band gap values

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- xgboost
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook or script:  
   Open `chem_final_cbp.ipynb` in Jupyter and run the cells
